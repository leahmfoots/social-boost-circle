# Technical Architecture

## Overview

RoundAbout is built as a modern web application using React, TypeScript, and Supabase for backend services. The architecture follows a component-based design with clear separation of concerns and scalable patterns.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18.3.1** - Component-based UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn/UI** - Pre-built component library
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **React Query** - Data fetching and state management
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

### Backend Services
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service platform
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Authentication system
  - Real-time subscriptions
  - Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
  - Row Level Security (RLS)

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Stripe** - Payment processing and subscription management
- **Social Media APIs** - Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook
- **React Stripe Elements** - Stripe payment components

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture

│   ├── ui/              # Base UI components (shadcn)
│   ├── auth/            # Authentication components
│   ├── payment/         # Payment-related components
│   ├── social/          # Social media integration
│   └── ...              # Feature-specific components
├── pages/               # Route-level page components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── contexts/            # React context providers
├── lib/                 # Utility libraries
└── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
```

### State Management
- **React Context** - Global state for authentication and user data
- **React Query** - Server state management and caching
- **Local State** - Component-level state with useState/useReducer

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User authenticates through Supabase Auth
   - JWT token stored in browser
   - Protected routes check authentication status
   - User profile data fetched and cached

2. **Social Account Integration**
   - OAuth flow with social platforms
   - Account data stored in Supabase
   - Real-time sync with platform APIs

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Stripe Checkout for subscriptions
   - Webhook handling for payment events
   - Subscription status stored in database

## Database Architecture

### Core Tables
- **profiles** - User profile information
- **social_accounts** - Connected social media accounts
- **engagements** - User engagement activities
- **subscribers** - Subscription and payment status
- **rewards** - Available rewards catalog
- **notifications** - User notifications

### Security Model
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforced on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Service role bypasses RLS for administrative functions
- API keys and secrets stored in Supabase Vault

## API Architecture

### Supabase Edge Functions
- **create-subscription** - Handle Stripe subscription creation
- **check-subscription** - Verify and update subscription status
- **customer-portal** - Generate Stripe customer portal sessions
- **connect-social-account** - Handle social media OAuth

### REST API Patterns
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Standardized error responses
- Rate limiting and authentication middleware
- Pagination for large datasets

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management and refresh tokens

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- API key rotation and management
- CORS policies for cross-origin requests

### Privacy & Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data anonymization for analytics
- User consent management
- Right to deletion and data export

## Performance Architecture

### Frontend Optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization and CDN delivery
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Bundle size optimization

### Backend Optimization
- Database indexing for fast queries
- Connection pooling
- Caching strategies with Redis
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Monitoring & Observability
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics
- Database performance metrics

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure
- **Frontend** - Deployed on Vercel/Netlify
- **Backend** - Supabase managed infrastructure
- **CDN** - Global content delivery
- **Monitoring** - Uptime and performance tracking

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Code push to GitHub
2. Automated testing suite
3. Build and bundle optimization
4. Deployment to staging environment
5. Manual approval for production
6. Database migrations
7. Production deployment

### Environment Management
- Development environment for local testing
- Staging environment for integration testing
- Production environment for live users
- Environment-specific configuration

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
- Database read replicas
- Load balancing across regions
- Auto-scaling based on demand
